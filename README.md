# No Script YouTube

A youtube client that does not use Javascript

### How it works?

For the video, the URL that matches the source of the video is taken and the HTML5 video player is used to display it. Instead, for other information, the ytdl-core library of nodejs is used, which through web scraping takes basic information such as channel and recommended videos. The styling uses TailwindCSS
